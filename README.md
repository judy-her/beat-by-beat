# Beat By Beat 

## Description
Introducing Beat by Beat, a web application that merges music discovery and video streaming. Our motivation was to build a one-stop platform for music enthusiasts to not only listen to their favorite tracks but also explore associated music videos and artist data. We built Beat by Beat to solve the hassle of switching between platforms to access this content. This project taught us about integrating various APIs and creating a user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS.
